## Student Information
**Name:** Georgio Elias

## API Used
**TheSportsDB** - https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php

TheSportsDB is a free sports database API that provides comprehensive football data including:
- League standings and tables
- Team information and statistics
- Match results and fixtures
- Player data and statistics

The API is accessed through RESTful endpoints and returns JSON data. The application implements caching and fallback mock data to ensure reliability.

## Custom UI Requirement Explanation
**Requirement:** Implement tabbed navigation using JavaScript

**Implementation:**
The custom tabbed navigation system is implemented through an ES6 class called `TabManager` located in `src/utils/tabManager.ts`. This class manages all aspects of the tabbed interface functionality.

**Key Features:**
- **ES6 Class Structure**: The `TabManager` class uses modern JavaScript syntax with constructor, methods, and properties
- **Dynamic Tab Switching**: Handles switching between different data views (Live Matches, League Tables, Team Stats, Recent Results)
- **API Integration**: Each tab loads specific data from TheSportsDB API when activated
- **State Management**: Manages loading states, error handling, and data caching
- **User Feedback**: Provides toast notifications and loading indicators during tab transitions

**Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
class TabManager {
  constructor(activeTab, setActiveTab, setTabData, setLoading) {
    this.activeTab = activeTab;
    this.setActiveTab = setActiveTab;
    this.setTabData = setTabData;
    this.setLoading = setLoading;
    this.api = new FootballAPI();
  }

  async switchTab(tabId, competition, season) {
    // Handles tab switching logic, API calls, and error handling
  }
}
```

The tabbed navigation provides a smooth user experience with CSS transitions and maintains data consistency across different views. Users can easily switch between different types of football data while the system handles loading states and error conditions gracefully.
